# ALGE: Active Learning Based on Graph Entropy
The repository contains the codes and data for the "Precise influence evaluation in complex networks".
# Overview
For code, we provide the codes of our method ALGE and other algorithms for comparison of influence evaluation, which are stored in **influence_evaluation** folder. And for influence maximization problem(IMP), the codes of our ALGE-Greedy algorithm and analysis is provided in **influence_maximization** folder.
