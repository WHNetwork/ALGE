# ALGE: Active Learning Based on Graph Entropy
The repository contains the codes and data for the "Precise influence evaluation in complex networks".
# Overview
For code, we provide the codes of our method ALGE and other algorithms for comparison of influence evaluation, which are stored in **influence_evaluation** folder. And for influence maximization problem(IMP), the codes of our ALGE-Greedy algorithm and analysis is provided in **influence_maximization** folder.

For data, we provide the networks for train and prediction in our work, using **csv** format with **node** and **edge** of netwokrs. The synthetic networks for train are generated by us and attached the influence simulation results for train.
